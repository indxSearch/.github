**Indx** is a free, high-performance, enterprise-ready, embeddable search engine for **.NET**.

### What makes Indx different?

- **Pattern-based, not word-based**  
  Indx uses pattern recognition rather than a lexical model. It matches fragments of similar structure, where shape and length influence recognition — enabling robust matching across variations.

- **Whole-query indexing**  
  Instead of indexing individual tokens, Indx indexes entire indexable strings, allowing it to understand relationships between terms — not just their presence.

- **Zero-configuration by design**  
  Indx has no analyzers, schemas, or language-specific tuning. There are no stop words, no stemming rules, and no tokenizer configuration. You index data and search it — that’s it.

Together, this makes Indx less like a traditional search engine and more like a precision instrument for structured, high-performance search.
